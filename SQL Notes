SQL Notes:
----------

1. What is SQL?
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language.It is a programming lanuage used to manaage relation database systems.
- SQL allow us to do query,insert,update and delete and lot more operations in the relational databases.

2.What is the order of SQL query execution?
- The order of SQL clauses are: from - where - group by - having  - select - order by - limit.

3.What are the funcations of cluases in the SQL order?
- from : It choose and join the tables to fetch base data.
- where : Filter the base data.
- group by : Aggregates the base data.
- having : Filter the aggregated data.
- select: Returns the final data.
- order by : Sort the final data.
- limit: Limits the returned data to a row count.

3.What is the basic difference between SQL and NOSQL databases?
- SQL databases work with organized and structured data.SQL language is used to deal with relational databases.On the other hand,Nosql databases 
- Use unstructed data and it is works for nonrelatoional databases.
- Eg for SQL database: Oracle,MS SQL,MySQL,PostgreSQL
- Eg for NoSQL databases: MongoDB

4.Explain the difference between inner join,left join and right join?
- INNER JOIN : It joins the records from both tables that matching the associated condition.
- LEFT JOIN : It returns the result by joining all records of left table with the matching records of right table.It is also called LFET OUTER JOIN.
- RIGHT JOIN : It returns the result of joining all the records of right table with the matching records from left table.It is also called RIGHT OUTER JOIN.

5.What is the difference between Normalization and Denormalization?
- Normalization is the process of organising data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data intagrity.
- Denormalization is the process of combaing tables to minimize the no.of joins for query optimization.

6.What is ACID properties?
- ACID stands for Atomicity Consistency Isolation and Durability.
- Atomicity means if any operation in performed on the data, either it should be executed completely or
  it should not be executed at all.It means the operation should not break in between or execute partially.
- Consistency means if any change is performed on the data,database must ensure the intagrity 
  by confirming that the data is remain consistent before and after the the change.
- Isolation ensures that all transactions run in an isolated environment. 
  That enables running transactions concurrently because transactions donâ€™t interfere with each other.
- The durability property states that once the execution of a transaction is completed, the modifications and updates 
  on the database gets written on and stored in the disk. These persist even after the occurrence of a system failure. 

7.What is the difference between GROUP BY and HAVING clause?
- GROUP BY clause is used to group identical data into groups and typically to perform aggregate functions on each group.
- HAVING clause is used in combination with GROUP BY to filter the results based on a condition applied to the grouped data.
